## Let Google and Alexa welcome customers to your business

Business Assistant is a an assistant for the Amazon Alexa and Google Actions platforms with which *the developer* (and people included in their Beta test) can interact with your business.

###### Why would anyone need such an assistant?

Most businesses have a website where customers go to learn more, buy products, and send feedback. Voice apps present the opportunity for customers to engage with your business in a new, creative, way.
My motivation for developing this is that I have no really convenient way of demoing our expertise to our customers. I have a website, but, I want to easily give customers my business card and give them an easy way to contact my business without having to navigate to my website. The disadvantage is customers are much less familiar with businesses with voice apps and much more familiar with websites.

###### But this assistant has downsides, too, right?

Yes, a lot, but they are not very painful to me. Potential disadvantages are:
- You need internet access to use the assistant
- In all honesty, you need to have basic dev skills with Alexa and AWS

###### Alright, I might give it a try. What do I need to get this running?

You will need:
- This repository and its dependencies
- It it extremely convenient to run it locally using the Jovo CLI
- The basics for Alexa Skill development (Alexa Dev account, an AWS Lambda function to run this code on)
- The basics for Google Action development (Dialogflow & Google Actions account, an AWS Lambda function with AWS API Gateway to run this code on)
- Logo images to include in your business card

You should be able to get this running locally by cloning the repository, installing the dependencies, and then running `jovo run` in the main folder.

###### And how does it work?

Meh, there's no rocket science involved. Just look at the code! :)

###### Oh-kay... At least tell us how to config all of this

Alright. There is really no configuration besides updating the values in `app/app.js` to match your business.

###### Wait! I have so many more questions about this...

Sure, feel free to ask, really! I think I will expand upon this project and its documentation later.

Looking forward to your Twitter DM, email or issue! :)
